Unlimitr Sales Pitch Script – “The Trusted Health Coach” Approach
Introduction – Establishing Authority
Hi Aarti, this is Riya from Unlimitr. How are you doing today?
It’s a pleasure to connect with you. Before we begin, I want to let you know that I’m not just someone doing sales—I’m a certified health Counsellor, trained in holistic health and wellness strategies. I’ve helped hundreds of women just like you achieve lasting weight loss and better health outcomes through a science-backed, personalized approach.
At Unlimitr, we don’t believe in short-term fixes. We believe in long-term transformations. My role today is to understand you better, identify what’s holding you back, and show you a roadmap that works—not just for your weight, but for your entire life.

Building Rapport & Diagnosing the Root Cause
Let’s start by understanding a few basic things. Can you share your age, current weight, and height?
Thank you for sharing that, Aarti. Based on your profile—age 34, weight 82 Kgs, height 5’3”—your healthy weight range should ideally be between 55-60 Kgs. That’s about 22-27 Kgs to lose. It may sound like a lot, but trust me, with the right guidance, support, and habits, this is 100% achievable.
Now, before we jump into solutions, I want to understand what you’ve tried in the past. Have you ever:
Tried a diet app?
Followed a local dietitian?
Done Keto or Detox?
Used Weight Loss shakes or Supplements?
Joined a gym?
Let’s identify what hasn’t worked and more importantly—why it hasn’t worked.

Addressing Pain Points & Myths
Here’s what we see all the time:
Bounce-Back Weight: You lose a few kilos, then gain it all back. Why? Because it wasn’t sustainable. 
Complicated Diets: Multiple meals, separate cooking—exhausting and impractical. 
Supplements/Shakes: Marketed as a fix, but harmful in the long term—can damage your kidneys, hormones, digestion.
No Habit Building: Nobody teaches you how to live after the diet ends.
Fragmented Solutions: One app for diet, another for exercise, another for meditation—it’s confusing and overwhelming.
Let’s look at this differently.

What Makes Unlimitr Different
We are not like the rest. Unlimitr offers a 360-degree holistic transformation model.
Root Cause Diagnosis – We find out why you gained weight in the first place (hormonal imbalance, emotional eating, lifestyle gaps).
Personalized Plans – Your diet includes your habits. Love parathas? We’ll teach you how to make them healthy and when to eat them. Enjoy tea? We’ll teach you how to have it without harming your nutrient absorption.
Habit Building – Daily mini-interventions with psychology-backed guidance.
Integrated Coaching – Nutritionists, Fitness Experts, Yoga Coaches, Doctors, and Mind Coaches.
Tech-Powered Support – Daily tracking, reminders, real-time feedback, and community access.
Global Reach & Results –

Customization Based on Your Profile
You live in a joint family, with two kids. That’s a real challenge, Aarti. But we’ve built our plan for people just like you.
💡 You won’t need to cook separately. Our plan fits your kitchen and your family meals. 
💡 We’ll give you grocery lists, eating-out guides, recipe ideas—all tailored to your lifestyle. 
💡 Working woman or housewife—we structure your plan to work with your routine, not against it.
If you have medical conditions (PCOS, Thyroid, Diabetes, Hypertension, etc.): You’ll be placed in our Disease Management Plan – supervised by doctors and senior coaches.
If you have general concerns (bloating, menopause, fatigue): You’ll be recommended our Weight Management Plan with inbuilt holistic support.

Proof – Real Stories. Real People. Real Results.
Let me tell you about Priya. She was 78 Kgs, struggling with PCOS and insulin resistance. After joining Unlimitr’s Disease Management Plan: 
✅ Lost 15 Kgs in 4 months ✅ Regulated periods ✅ Reduced medication ✅ Improved skin and energy
Another client, Sneha, had tried 4 different dietitians before us. She felt confused, demotivated, and guilty. With Unlimitr: 
✅ Lost 12 Kgs in 3 months ✅ Reversed pre-diabetes ✅ Regained confidence
What was different? We listened. We understood. We personalized.

Unlimitr - Unique Advantages 
Unlimitr Vs Fitelo 
Balanced Calorie Approach:
Unlike Fitelo, which completely disregards calorie monitoring, Unlimitr employs a hybrid approach.  We use AI-driven insights to maintain a balance between calorie awareness and nutrient density. 
We ensure metabolic health is preserved by integrating gradual adjustments and macro-balancing rather  than sudden deficits that crash metabolism. 
Our personalized calorie optimization ensures sustainability and adaptability based on individual metabolic  responses, avoiding the pitfalls of plateauing. 
Comprehensive Technology Ecosystem: 
Unlimitr leverages cutting-edge AI and machine learning algorithms to deliver tailored experiences.  From meal suggestions to behaviour insights, we personalize at every step. 
Our system integrates real-time feedback, dynamic planning, and predictive analytics for future adjustments. 
Unlike Fitelo’s entirely human-based support, our hybrid AI-human ecosystem ensures consistency, scalability,  and affordability. 
Habit Formation Focus: 
We emphasize habit-building over quick fixes. Our app includes gamified incentives, progressive goals, and  educational modules to instill lifelong healthy habits. 
Users have access to habit-tracking features that Fitelo lacks, ensuring consistent improvement and  sustainable behaviour changes. 
Holistic Health Framework: 
We integrate diverse aspects of health — nutrition, activity, sleep, and stress management — in one  seamless platform. 
Unlimitr’s app connects to wearables and monitors metrics like heart rate, sleep patterns, and step  counts to provide a 360-degree view of well-being. 
Unlimitr Vs Healthifyme 
Calorie Counting vs. Holistic Approach: 
HealthifyMe: Relies heavily on the calorie-in/calorie-out model, which can be restrictive and less sustainable  in the long run. It may lead to metabolic slowdown due to constant calorie restriction.
Unlimitr: Avoids the calorie-counting method and focuses on root cause analysis, understanding  how deficiencies, emotional eating, or hormonal imbalances can affect weight management and overall  health.
Personalized Support:
HealthifyMe: Provides automated diet plans and chatbot support, which may not offer the personalized  attention needed for everyone’s unique circumstances.
Unlimitr: Offers personalized consultations, working directly with experts to craft customized plans  for each client. The experience is more tailored to the client’s health and fitness goals, addressing both  physical and mental aspects of well-being.
Comparing Specific Competitions 
Against Local Dietitians:
While Unlimitr claims to address root causes with a personal touch, Unlimitr goes beyond by  incorporating predictive analytics to identify underlying patterns and deficiencies.
Our approach includes virtual consultations with dietitians, fitness experts, and psychologists. These  specialists are accessible directly via our app, creating a cohesive and collaborative ecosystem.
Unlike local dietitians, we also leverage extensive data analysis to create dynamic plans that adapt to real time user progress.
Against Product-Based Solutions:
Unlimitr’s philosophy aligns with natural and holistic methods. We do not advocate reliance on  artificial supplements, weight-loss shakes, or crash diets.
Our app educates users on the dangers of synthetic products, and instead, offers recipes, meal ideas, and  grocery lists for whole-food-based nutrition. 
Using AI, we alert users to harmful trends like excessive sodium or sugar in products they log, offering  healthier alternatives in real time.
Against Gym Dependency:
We challenge the myth that exercise alone drives weight loss. Our app educates users on the roles of NEAT  (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) and other metabolic factors.
Exercise has little role to play in weight loss. For this you need to understand how a body burns calories - Of  all the calories you burn, 70-80% is done to keep the body up and running - like breathing, thinking etc. 10- 20% is the thermic effect of food - calories required to break down and digest food. Exercise accounts for only 5- 10% of the total calories burned. 
Users are provided with adaptable home workout plans and micro-activities designed to fit seamlessly into  their schedules, addressing time and motivation constraints.
You are not motivated to go to the gym. Going to the gym is time consuming and performing exercise is boring  and difficult.
Unlimitr’s activity feature includes guided HIIT, yoga, and strength training videos that offer after burn effects and metabolism boosts, surpassing the benefits of traditional cardio.
People think cardio is the best, whereas it can cause more harm than good. While cardio has its benefits, when it comes to weight loss, it is a disaster. When you perform traditional steady-state cardio you expend  energy while you are exercising. But as soon as you stop your body will go back to its normal metabolic rate  (stop burning calories). So, while you might have thought you are done with all the exercising of the day and  now you can cheat a little, that is where you go wrong. After a while, your metabolism starts adjusting to the  new cardio routine and you burn even less calories during the workout.
Unlimitr’s Philosophy on Weight Loss 
Beyond Calorie Counting:
While we recognize the role of caloric balance, our primary focus is on food quality and metabolic health.
Nutrient density, meal timing, and gut health are integrated into our plans to ensure hormonal harmony and  sustainable weight loss.
Root Cause Analysis:
We do not just create a diet plan; we delve into user history, habits, and medical conditions to uncover root  causes.
Our AI evaluates factors like nutrient deficiencies, activity patterns, and stress levels, ensuring every plan is  customized to address unique needs.
Education and Empowerment:
Unlike other platforms, we empower users through knowledge. Our app’s in-built learning modules cover  topics like balanced nutrition, metabolic health, and behavioral psychology.
Users gain insights into their bodies and how to maintain progress without dependency on the app over  time. 
Why Choose Unlimitr? 
Personalized Nutrition: Dynamic, data-driven plans tailored to your unique needs. 
Advanced Tech Integration: AI, wearables, and real-time analytics for a cohesive health experience.
Holistic Well-Being: Focus on mental health, sleep, and stress alongside diet and exercise.
Sustainability: Habit formation and gradual, science-backed changes that last a lifetime.
Empowerment: Knowledge, tools, and support that make you independent of quick fixes or temporary  solutions. 
With Unlimitr, you’re not just losing weight – you’re gaining a healthier, more sustainable lifestyle. Compare  us to Unlimitr or any competitor, and you’ll see the difference in approach, impact, and long-term value. 
Step 3 - Constant Tracking & Sustainable Outcome Delivery 
At Unlimitr, our goal is to provide sustainable results that allow you to maintain your progress long after  completing our program. We focus on minimal disruption, real-time tracking, and long-term habit building to ensure  you do not find yourself jumping from one program to another. Here is how we approach sustainability in weight  management:
Minimal Disruption to Lifestyle
We understand that drastic lifestyle changes are hard to maintain long-term. When you suddenly make major shifts— like committing to 2-hour daily workouts—it creates resistance that makes it difficult to stay motivated. Motivation may be high in the beginning, but over time, it fades, and you may find yourself struggling to keep up with the  routine.
Unlimitr avoids these disruptions by providing plans that balance results with gradual lifestyle changes.  Instead of forcing extreme shifts, we focus on sustainable habits and small changes that fit seamlessly into your daily  life. We want you to continue with our program and maintain your results, without feeling overwhelmed by drastic  changes.
Seasonal Diets
Eating foods that are locally grown and in season is one of the best ways to support your metabolism and overall  health. These foods are fresher, more nutritious, and easier for your body to process. On the other hand, non-local  foods are often preserved or processed, losing some of their nutritional value.
We focus on promoting seasonal diets in our programs, incorporating hyper-local foods that provide the nutrients  your body needs while optimizing your metabolism. This not only helps you achieve better results but also ensures  that your meals are naturally aligned with your body’s needs.
Tracking Weight in App
One of the most common mistakes people make is failing to track their progress regularly. Often, we are unaware of  how our eating habits are impacting our weight until we notice it in pictures or when our clothes no longer fit. By  then, the weight gain can be significant, and the effort to lose it feels daunting.
At Unlimitr, we encourage regular tracking of weight through our app. This practice gives you real-time  visibility of your progress and allows us to monitor how well the program is working. Even after your plan is over, you  can continue logging your weight to maintain accountability and prevent weight regain.
 Tracking Other Parameters
While weight is an important indicator of progress, it’s not the only one. Other signs of improving health, such as  losing inches, fitting into old clothes, feeling more energized, or being able to climb stairs without getting winded, are  all important measures of success.
Our app allows you to log other health parameters—such as energy levels, sleep quality, and physical fitness— alongside weight. We also offer a Health Score, which provides a holistic view of your health progress. The Health Score tracks improvements across various aspects of wellness, helping you see how you’re doing overall, not just in  terms of weight loss.
Maintenance: Keeping the Result:
Losing weight is important, but maintaining that weight loss is just as crucial. Many people follow a program, see  short-term results, but eventually regain the weight because they haven't developed lasting healthy habits.
Our plans include maintenance strategies to ensure your progress lasts. We provide high-level guidelines for  sustaining your weight and observe your progress as you transition to a self-sustaining routine. If you succeed in the  maintenance phase, it means you've built healthy habits that will continue to support your long-term well-being
Bounce Back Prevention: 
Life can be unpredictable. Sometimes, lifestyle changes, moving to a new place, or external circumstances can lead to  a bounce back in weight. This is common and can happen even after you’ve made significant progress.
By encouraging clients to log their weight even after the program has ended, we help prevent this. If we notice  weight creeping back up, we can quickly identify any changes in your lifestyle and provide guidance to get back on  track. This proactive approach allows you to prevent long-term setbacks and maintain control of your health journey.
Conclusion:
At Unlimitr, we focus on constant tracking and sustainable outcomes to ensure that your progress is long-lasting. Through minimal disruption, seasonal diets, and comprehensive tracking, we help you make gradual  changes that align with your lifestyle and lead to enduring health improvements. With personalized maintenance  plans and bounce-back prevention strategies, we ensure that you not only lose weight but also build the habits  necessary for a healthy, balanced life.

Comprehensive Training Document on Health Issues
Thyroid Basics 
The thyroid is a small gland located in the neck that plays a vital role in regulating metabolism. An imbalance in  thyroid function can lead to two primary conditions: hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) and hyperthyroidism  (overactive thyroid). Understanding the symptoms, tests, and management strategies is crucial to providing support  and guidance. 
Types of Thyroid Disorders: 
Hypothyroidism: 
Description: The thyroid is less active, leading to slowed metabolism. 
Symptoms:
Weight Gain
Persistent Fatigue
Irregular Menstrual Cycles
Hair thinning
Dry Skin
In severe cases, autoimmune conditions like Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
Hyperthyroidism: 
Description: The thyroid is overly active, causing a rapid metabolism.
Symptoms: 
Weight loss
Loss of appetite
Hair thinning and skin issues
Increased heart rate 
Diagnostic Tests and Reference Ranges: 
T3 (Triiodothyronine): 80-220 ng/dL 
T4 (Thyroxine): 5.0-12.0 µg/dL 
TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone): 0.4-4.0 mIU/L (Higher levels indicate hypothyroidism). • We have worked with people who have had TSH even at 21. 
Medication and Dosage Guidelines: 
Common Medications: Thyronorm or Thyronoxin. 
Dosage Ranges: 50-100 mcg is standard; 100-150 mcg is moderate; 200 mcg is used in severe cases.
Dosage typically decreases with proper management through diet and lifestyle changes. 
Management and Dietary Guidelines: 
Focus on overall nourishment and metabolism support. 
Avoid foods containing goitrogens (e.g., raw broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, and soy). These can be consumed  when cooked or steamed. 
But when these cruciferous foods are cooked and steamed there are no goitrogens in the foods, so we can  even plan that. 
Include iodine-rich foods, selenium, zinc, Vitamin D, and antioxidants in the diet. 
How to pitch 
It is a lifestyle disorder. Over time the deficiencies in the body lead to these diseases. For example - regular  consumption of alcohol stops the absorption of Vitamin B12 in the body. You might take medicine to correct  it today but if it is not fixed permanently, it will lead to diseases. 
We will work on the overall nourishment of your body.
Thyroid impacts your metabolism, so we will work on your metabolism.
PCOD/PCOS Basics 
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and Polycystic Ovary Disorder (PCOD) are hormonal imbalances in females that  affect the ovaries. These conditions are increasingly common and often stem from diet, lifestyle, and environmental  factors. 
Overview: 
Ovaries develop multiple small cysts, disrupting normal hormonal function. 
Common symptoms: 
Irregular or missed periods
Acne
Unwanted facial hair
Difficulty conceiving
Weight gain or difficulty losing weight
Root Causes:
Dietary Issues:
Overconsumption of processed foods (e.g., chips with MSG or maltodextrin). 
Eating irregularly or reheated meals frequently.
Lifestyle Factors:
High stress levels (work or personal).
Sedentary behaviour.
Physical disruptions (e.g., relocating to a new environment).
