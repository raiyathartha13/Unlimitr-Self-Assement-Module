# 3D body models

Place your GLTF files here:

- `male_body.glb` — used when user selects Male
- `female_body.glb` — used when user selects Female

If these files are missing, the journey page shows a fallback capsule body with a simulated morph (scale) when you move the slider.

For best results, use models that support morph targets (e.g. waist, chest, arms, hips). You can export from Blender or use free sources (e.g. Sketchfab, HumanScanRepository) and convert to GLTF.
